# About This Project
Remember the old [Attendance-Seeker](https://github.com/prana-W/Attendance-Seeker) extension? Well, forget about that!

Introducing a full-stack web application designed to give you complete control and insight into your college attendance.

### ✨ Features

2. `cd Attendance-Seeker-v2`
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Enter your login credentials in the '.env' file.
